### WARNING - This package modifies database tables. Use with extreme caution and back up databases before running.

#### Always perform a dry run (this is the default action) first before specifying the `--execute (-e)` option.

What is it?
-----------

DbSync is a tool for efficiently comparing and synchronising two or more remote MySQL database tables.

In order to do this without comparing every byte of data, the tool preforms a checksum (MD5, SHA1, CRC32)
over a range of rows on both the source and destination tables, and compares only the hash. If a block is found to have
an inconsistency in a block, the tool performs a checksum on each half of the block, recursively (down to a minimum
block transfer size), until it finds the inconsistency.


Notes About Deletion
--------------------
DbSync will only delete rows from the destination that no longer exist on the source when the `--delete` option is specified.
Use this option with extreme caution. Always perform a dry run first.

If you use DbSync to synchronise a table which has row deletions on the source without using the `--delete` option,
DbSync will find inconsistencies in any block with a deleted row on every run but will not be able to remove the rows from the target.


Installation
------------

Via composer - run the following command in your project directory:

    composer require mrjgreen/db-sync

Or use the packaged archive directly

    wget https://github.com/mrjgreen/db-sync/raw/v3/db-sync.phar -O db-sync.phar
    chmod a+x db-sync.phar

Optionally make the command available globally

    sudo mv db-sync.phar /usr/bin/db-sync

```
Usage:
db-sync [options] <source> <target> <table>

Sync a mysql database table from one host to another using an efficient checksum algorithm to find differences.

```

### Examples

*Note - All of these commands will perform a "dry-run" only. To execute the insert/update statement against the target
database, you must specify the --execute (-e) option*

##### Example 1

Sync the table `web.customers` from one host to another (non-standard port on target):

```
db-sync --user root --password mypass 127.0.0.1 111.222.3.44:13306 web.customers
```

##### Example 2

Sync the table `web.customers` from one host to another, deleting rows from the target that no longer exist on the source (using SHA1 hash for comparison):
```
db-sync --user root --password mypass --hash sha1 --delete 127.0.0.1 111.222.3.44 web.customers
```

##### Example 3

Sync the table `web.customers` from one host to another using different credentials:

```
db-sync --user root --password mypass --target.user admin --target.password password 127.0.0.1 111.222.3.44 web.customers:
```

##### Example 4

Sync only the `email` and `name` fields from the table `web.customers`:

 > NB. The primary key will automatically be included in the column set

```
db-sync --user root --password mypass 127.0.0.1 111.222.3.44 web.customers -c email -c name
```

##### Example 5

Sync every column except for the `updated_at` fields from the table `web.customers`:

```
db-sync --user root --password mypass 127.0.0.1 111.222.3.44 web.customers -i updated_at
```

##### Example 6

Sync every column from the table `web.customers` but only use the `updated_at` fields when calculating the hash:

 > Inconsistencies in other fields will not be detected. In the event of a hash inconsistency in fields which are
 included, the excluded fields will still be copied to the target host.

```
db-sync --user root --password mypass 127.0.0.1 111.222.3.44 web.customers -C updated_at
```

##### Example 7

Sync every column from the table `web.customers` and use all fields except for the `notes` or `info` fields when calculating the hash:

 > Inconsistencies in excluded fields will not be detected. In the event of a hash inconsistency in fields which are included,
 the excluded fields will still be copied to the target host.

 > This is especially useful for tables with long text fields that don't change after initial insert, or which are associated
 with an `on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` field. For large tables this can offer a big performance boost.

```
db-sync --user root --password mypass 127.0.0.1 111.222.3.44 web.customers -I notes -I info
```

##### Example 8

Sync the table `web.customers` to a table under a different name in a different database `web_backup.customers_2`:

```
db-sync --user root --password mypass --target.table web_backup.customers_2 127.0.0.1 111.222.3.44 web.customers
```


Config File
-----------

To avoid having to specify options repeatedly, and to avoid exposing your password on the tty you can specify a config file.
By default DbSync will look for a file named `dbsync.ini` in the current working directory.

Example:

```ini
user=root
password=mypass
target.user=admin
target.password=myadminpass
```

Use library within project (non-commandline)
--------------------------------------------

You can include the library within your project and use the components directly:

```PHP
use \DbSync\DbSync;
use \DbSync\Transfer;
use \DbSync\Hash\ShaHash;
use \DbSync\Table;
use \DbSync\ColumnConfiguration;

$sync = new DbSync(new Transfer(new ShaHash(), $blockSize, $transferSize));

$sync->setLogger(new YourPsrLogger());

$sync->dryRun(false);

$sync->delete(true);

$sourceTable = new Table($sourceConnection, $sourceDb, $sourceTable);
$targetTable = new Table($targetConnection, $targetDb, $targetTable);

// if you only want specific columns
$columnConfig = new ColumnConfiguration($syncColumns, $ignoreColumns);

// optionally apply a where clause - this can be useful when sync-ing large tables, where
// you can make use of a column to rule out large portions of the data
// that you know haven't changed, such as columns with "on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP" etc..
$sourceTable->setWhereClause(new WhereClause("column_name = ?", ['value']));
$targetTable->setWhereClause(new WhereClause("column_name > ?", ['value']));

$sync->sync($sourceTable, $targetTable, $columnConfig);
```

Testing
-------

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used to create a one-off mysql database, so you need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) before you can run the tests.

When docker is installed, you need to setup [the mysql image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mysql/mysql-server/) and run the tests.
Fortunately, this is very easy to do.

1. `composer docker:setup` - setup the mysql image.
2. `composer test` - run the tests in phpunit.

The mysql image will keep running in docker, until you remove it via `composer docker:clean`. You can re-run the tests anytime via `composer test`. Do not run `composer docker:setup` again, unless you have removed the mysql image.

Roadmap
-------

 * [x] 100% test coverage via full stack integration tests
 * [x] Allow option to delete data from target where not present on the source
 * [x] Use symfony console command for sync
 * [ ] Option to re-try with back-off on lock wait timeouts
 * [ ] Option to create missing tables on target
 * [ ] Option to skip duplicate key errors
 * [ ] Speed up initial sync of empty table - Maybe offer combination with other tool for full fast outfile based replacement

Requirements
------------

PHP 5.4 or above
PDO MySQL Extension
